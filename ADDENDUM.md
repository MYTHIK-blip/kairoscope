# ⬡ KAIROSCOPE Addendum: Our Covenant

This document outlines the core principles and commitments that guide the development and deployment of KAIROSCOPE, extending beyond the formal licenses to define our project's ethos and long-term vision.

## I. Provenance-Mandatory by Design

KAIROSCOPE is fundamentally built on the principle that **verifiable provenance is not optional**. Every piece of context transformed into an artifact within the KAIROSCOPE ecosystem shall, to the greatest extent technically feasible, carry an immutable, cryptographically attested record of its origin, transformations, and attestations. This commitment underpins the integrity and trustworthiness of all KAIROSCOPE-generated data.

## II. Anti-Enclosure & Open Ecosystem

We are committed to preventing data lock-in and fostering an open, interoperable ecosystem. KAIROSCOPE shall:

*   **Promote Open Standards:** Prioritize and integrate with open standards (e.g., C2PA, SLSA, Verifiable Credentials, Decentralized Identifiers) for data formats, protocols, and attestations.
*   **Ensure Data Portability:** Design artifacts and ledger entries to be easily exportable and usable outside the KAIROSCOPE system, without proprietary dependencies.
*   **Resist Vendor Lock-in:** Avoid architectural decisions that create exclusive dependencies on specific vendors or platforms, ensuring users retain control over their data and infrastructure choices.

## III. Continuity & Exportability

KAIROSCOPE aims to provide a resilient and enduring verifiable memory layer. This includes a commitment to:

*   **Long-Term Data Integrity:** Employ robust cryptographic methods and data structures designed for long-term integrity and resistance to tampering.
*   **Offline-First Capability:** Prioritize functionality that operates reliably without constant network connectivity, ensuring continuity in diverse environments.
*   **Easy Export & Migration:** Provide clear, well-documented mechanisms for users to export their data, including artifacts, ledgers, and keys, for backup, migration, or use with other systems.

## IV. Ethical AI & Data Sovereignty

As KAIROSCOPE integrates advanced interpretation and AI capabilities, we commit to:

*   **Verifiable AI Provenance:** Ensure that any AI-driven insights or transformations applied to artifacts are themselves attested and auditable, promoting AI accountability and explainability.
*   **User Data Sovereignty:** Empower users with ultimate control over their data. This includes mechanisms for selective disclosure, granular access control, and clear consent for data processing.
*   **Bias Mitigation:** Actively work to identify and mitigate algorithmic bias in AI components, ensuring fairness and equity in attested interpretations.

## V. Medallion Grammar (⬡)

The Medallion (⬡) symbolizes KAIROSCOPE's progressive development path and commitment to quality, transparency, and verifiable milestones. Each medallion represents a significant gate passed, signifying a new level of capability and assurance.

This covenant is a living document, subject to refinement as the KAIROSCOPE project evolves, always guided by our core ethos of building a trustworthy and resilient verifiable memory for the digital age.
